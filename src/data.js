    title : "Vandelaga tambali (Ekpanni tambali)",

Ingredients: 1 cup Vandelaga(brahmi) leaves 4-5 green chilles 3/4th cup fresh/frozen grated Coconut 1 tspn cumin seeds 1/2 tspn ghee 1/4 tea spn pepper 1/4 tspn tamarind extract or 1-2 small pieces of tamarind Salt Method:Heat ghee and fry the leaves till they turn yellowish.

    title : "Banana Vada",
    recipe :"It was vade panchami few days ago – it is celebrated at my kuldevasthan – family god’s temple at Ankola. Thousands of deities gather for the pooja. One of the biggest things (other than super delicious lunch) during this function is these banana vada prasad – so the function is called vade panchami. Many men gather to make these vadas and then the vadas are deep fried in huge pan. Some remove the vadas from the hot oil just by their bare hands without a ladle/spoon. It has been a long tradition going on for decades. I found this video on youtube of this. I have explained more about vade panchami in this post.I was missing all these celebrations, so decided to try something similar. Ofcourse this is not the recipe followed at our temple but I just made it up. The vadas came out so delicious that I think I have to save the recipe.Pictorial:Ingredients: 1 and 1/2 cup rice flour 1/2 cup almond flour 1/2 cup coconut 1 cup milk 2 tbl spn jaggery 1 big banana (about 2/3rd cup mashed banana) Salt Oil for deep frying Method:Mix all the ingredients except oil in a bowl. Take a big ball of the mixture and flatten it on a plastic. Gently pick up the vada and deep fry in hot oil.Enjoy while it is still warm with chutney.",

    title : "Chickpeas Parathas",
    recipe : "We love parathas, I also find making kids lunchboxes (with some kind of protein) a big challenge every day. Today I had soaked chickpeas, so I decided to make these chickpeas parathas for their lunchbox. These were delicious and full of nutrients.I never use canned chickpeas. So I soak them fresh and make any dishes. If I forget to soak them beforehand, I soak them for an hour or two in hot water or put them in instantpot on yogurt mode for couple of hours. Then cooking them for couple of whistles in pressure cooker yields soft chickpeas. Use the cooked ones for this Chickpeas paratha or any other curries.Ingredients: 2 cups cooked chickpeas2 cups wheat flour 2 tbl spn mozerella cheese (optional) 2 tbl spn coriander leaves 1 tea spn chilli powder 1/2 tea spn garam masala 1/2 tea spn chaat masalaGheeOilSalt  Method: Make a loose dough with wheat flour, water, salt. Knead very well by adding a little oil. Leave it aside for atleast 30mins. Soak chickpeas overnight and pressure cook them. Grind them (without any water) to a smooth paste. Add salt, spices, cheese and coriander leaves.Mix it very well. Make balls from the mixture. Stuff the chickpeas balls in the dough. Carefully roll them into parathas.Roast on hot tava applying enough ghee. Serve hot with pickle or any other side.Makes about 4-5 parathas Preparation time : 30mins",

    title:"Mixed Greens Khichdi",
    recipe:"I usually get a huge pack of mixed greens from Costco that gets used enthusiastically for few days. Since it goes bad quickly, I try to make few different recipes – this also makes sure we consume all of those greens in two-three weeks’ time. This Mixed Greens Khichdi is one of those dishes. It tastes great, it is a one-pot dish that comes together quickly, it is healthy, so it checks all the right boxes. I prefer making this dish in InstantPot because I can start the dish and walk away. But this can be easily prepared in a normal pressure cooker – I prepared it pressure cooker before I bought InstantPot.    You can make this Khichdi with just spinach or with a combination of few different greens. I have tried both and it comes out great with any combination. I have used masoor dal here, but this can also be prepared using moong dal.",
